# Sorting-Algorithms
A module with our 4 main sorting algorithms
### Toggling variables
-  I have created a variable named **size** to adjust the number of elements in the array.  You need only change that, the code builds the array for you.
-  At the bottom of the client file, you may toggle the words **bubble**, **selection**, **insertion**, and **merge** to test all of the sorting algorithms.
-  Make sure to "turn off" the sort with // to determine how long it takes to merely build the array.
-  To also factor out "compile time" run the program 3 times and take the average of the times for your final answer.
